  caption: The global N cycles and interactions with climate changes.
---
Anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (Nr) has significantly perturbated the global N cycle since the industrial revolution. However, the complexity of Nr cascades impedes further understanding in the effects of anthropogenic Nr. 

I﻿n this project, w﻿e established collaborations with an international model inter-comparison project (NMIP2), where eight C-N fully coupled terrestrial biosphere models were involoved, and the 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) team to quantify the effects of anthropogenic Nr on the global N cycle and climate changes. This project will bridge the disciplines among terrestrial biogeochemistry, atmospheric chemistry and climate sciences, and provide new insights to the N-cycle community.

abstract: Anthropogenic activities have substantially perturbed the global
  nitrogen (N) cycle directly through enhancing reactive N (Nr) inputs and
  indirectly through climate and land-use change. However, the climatic impacts
  of the N cycle and its feedbacks on climate change remain very uncertain. In
  this review, we provide an overview of the dominant pathways by which
  anthropogenic Nr affects the climate system and summarize the available
  scientific assessments. We also review the latest progress on the responses of
  N cycle to changing climate to understand the potential for feedbacks between
  the N cycle and climate. With the urgent need to reduce Nr in the future to
  alleviate its negative environmental impacts, e.g. air pollution and
  eutrophication, we highlight the importance for bridging disciplines of
  atmospheric chemistry, ecology, and climatology to improve the scientific
  understanding and develop cobenefits for both environmental protection and
  climate change mitigation.

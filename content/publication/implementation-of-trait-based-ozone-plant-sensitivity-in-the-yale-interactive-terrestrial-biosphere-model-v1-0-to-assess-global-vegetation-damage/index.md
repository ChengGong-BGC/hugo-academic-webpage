abstract: A major limitation in modeling global ozone (O3) vegetation damage has
  long been the reliance on empirical O3 sensitivity parameters derived from a
  limited number of species and applied at the level of plant functional types
  (PFTs), which ignore the large interspecific variations within the same PFT.
  Here, we present a major advance in large-scale assessments of O3 plant injury
  by linking the trait leaf mass per area (LMA) and plant O3 sensitivity in a
  broad and global perspective. Application of the new approach and a global LMA
  map in a dynamic global vegetation model reasonably represents the observed
  interspecific responses to O3 with a unified sensitivity parameter for all
  plant species. Simulations suggest a contemporary global mean reduction of
  4.8 % in gross primary productivity by O3, with a range of 1.1 %–12.6 % for
  varied PFTs. Hotspots with damage >10 % are found in agricultural areas in the
  eastern US, western Europe, eastern China, and India, accompanied by moderate
  to high levels of surface O3. Furthermore, we simulate the distribution of
  plant sensitivity to O3, which is highly linked with the inherent leaf trait
  trade-off strategies of plants, revealing high risks for fast-growing species
  with low LMA, such as crops, grasses, and deciduous trees.

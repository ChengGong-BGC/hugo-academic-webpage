Cheng Gong works as the postdoctroal fellow at Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany. His research interests include global biogeochemistry C-N cycles, atmosphere-biosphere interactions and atmospheric chemistry. He uses the atmospheric chemistry tranpsort model (GEOS-Chem), earth system model (ModelE2-YIBs) and terrestrial land model (QUINCY, ICON-L) to better understand the complex biogeochemical cycles globally and their impacts on climate.
